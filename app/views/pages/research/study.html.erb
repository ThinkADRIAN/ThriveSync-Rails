            You are invited to participate in a research study examining the usefulness of a mobile application,
            <%= link_to "ThriveSync", root_path %>, for mood tracking. We aim to develop a system that gives
            individuals a reliable and rigorous tool to monitor and explore their mood on their personal devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your mood is the temporary state of how you feel, and being aware of how your mood changes can impact
            your mental wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the study is to assess the use and effect of <%= link_to "ThriveSync", root_path %>
            for tracking how you feel, as well as any effects on mood stability, and management of mild-to-moderate
            stress, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression.

          <h4>What are the benefits of participating?</h4>
          <p>
            Actively monitoring or self-charting your state of mind is found to make it easier for some people to
            manage their moodâ€”for example, some may experience fewer mood swings. A number of positive outcomes have
            been related to successfully managing how you feel, such as good interpersonal and conflict-solving skills.
            ThriveSync is a web platform consisting of a website and an application, aimed at providing a quick,
            convenient way to monitor mood on your personal electronic devices. This platform allows you to track how
            you feel, and to share your data with someone else for social support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Possible benefits of participating in this study include improved ability to manage how you feel, and a
            more stable mood. It is also possible you will not benefit from tracking your mood with
            <%= link_to "ThriveSync", root_path %>. It is up to you whether you want to include another person, and
            how much data you want to share with that person. After the study period, you can keep using ThriveSync
            freely for an additional period of 12 months if you would like to.
          </p>
          <h4>What will you be doing as a participant?</h4>
          <p>
            As a participant, you will be given access to the <%= link_to "ThriveSync", root_path %> app, which you
            can use freely on your computer, phone, or other mobile device. At four points during a study period of
            12 weeks, you will be asked to complete a survey asking about your experiences using ThriveSync; the
            surveys will each take a maximum of 15 minutes to complete. Four weeks into the study, you will be given
            the option of sharing your mood data with someone you know, such as a family member, friend, or mental
            health provider. This feature is introduced in order to enable social support for mental wellbeing.
          </p>
          <h4>What are the requirements for participating?</h4>
          <p>
            As we are examining a mobile app, you can participate from whatever location you prefer. You must,
            however, have access to an electronic device where you can use the app, such as a computer or smart-phone,
            in order to participate (we support both Apple and Android devices). It is further required that
            participants are 18 years or older. You can participate regardless of what your mental health status is.
          </p>
          <h4>Who is conducting the study?</h4>
