# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        invitedp2: "Your mood is the temporary state of how you feel, and being aware of how your mood changes can impact your mental wellbeing."
        invitedp3_html: "The purpose of the study is to assess the use and effect of %{link} for tracking how you feel, as well as any effects on mood stability, and management of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression."

It is also possible you will not benefit from tracking your mood with %{link}. It is up to you whether you want to include another person, and how much data you want to share with that person. After the study period, you can keep using ThriveSync freely for an additional period of 12 months if you would like to.'

At four points during a study period of 12 weeks, you will be asked to complete a survey asking about your experiences using ThriveSync; the surveys will each take a maximum of 15 minutes to complete. Four weeks into the study, you will be given the option of sharing your mood data with someone you know, such as a family member, friend, or mental  health provider.
