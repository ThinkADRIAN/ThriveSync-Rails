# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        invitedp3_html: "The purpose of the study is to assess the use and effect of %{link} for tracking how you feel, as well as any effects on mood stability, and management of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression."

Four weeks into the study, you will be given the option of sharing your mood data with someone you know, such as a family member, friend, or mental  health provider.
